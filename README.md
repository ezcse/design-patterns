# Design Patterns in C++

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems that developers face when building software. Think of them as best practices or templates that you can follow to solve specific coding challenges. By using design patterns, you can write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.

At their core, design patterns are reusable templates that empower developers to address recurring challenges in software design. They offer a structured approach, promoting adaptability for specific design problems.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into three main categories based on what they focus on:

### 1. **Creational Patterns**: How Objects Are Created

These patterns are all about making sure objects are created in the best possible way for your situation. Instead of just using `new` to create an object, creational patterns give you more control over the creation process. They help you manage how objects are made, ensuring your code is flexible and can easily adapt to changes.

### 2. **Structural Patterns**: How Objects Are Organized

Structural patterns focus on how objects and classes fit together to form larger structures. These patterns are about making sure that if one part of your system changes, the rest doesn’t need to. They help you compose objects and classes in a way that makes your system more flexible and easier to understand.

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**: How Objects Communicate

Behavioral patterns deal with how objects interact and communicate with each other. These patterns help define clear roles and responsibilities for objects, making sure your system behaves correctly and is easy to manage and extend.

## Explore Individual Design Patterns

Each design pattern solves a specific problem in a certain way. Below are the types of patterns, with links to detailed explanations and examples of each:

### Creational Patterns

- **[Singleton Pattern](./Singleton-Pattern.md)**: Ensures there’s only one instance of a class and provides a global access point to it.
- **[Prototype Pattern](./Prototype-Pattern.md)**: Allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype).
- **[Factory Method Pattern](./Factory-Pattern.md)**: Lets you create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
- **[Abstract Factory Pattern](./Abstract-Factory-Pattern.md)**: Lets you create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **[Builder Pattern](./Builder-Pattern.md)**: Helps you construct complex objects step by step, separating the construction process from the final representation.

### Structural Patterns

- **[Adapter Pattern](./Adapter/README.md)**: Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **[Composite Pattern](./Composite/README.md)**: Lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **[Decorator Pattern](./Decorator/README.md)**: Adds new responsibilities to an object dynamically, without altering its structure.
- **[Facade Pattern](./Facade/README.md)**: Provides a simple interface to a complex system, making it easier to use.
- **[Flyweight Pattern](./Flyweight/README.md)**: Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
- **[Proxy Pattern](./Proxy/README.md)**: Provides a placeholder or proxy for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **[Chain of Responsibility Pattern](./ChainOfResponsibility/README.md)**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it along.
- **[Command Pattern](./Command/README.md)**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize and queue requests.
- **[Iterator Pattern](./Iterator/README.md)**: Provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **[Mediator Pattern](./Mediator/README.md)**: Defines an object that manages communication between other objects, promoting loose coupling.
- **[Memento Pattern](./Memento/README.md)**: Captures and restores an object’s internal state without breaking encapsulation.
- **[Observer Pattern](./Observer/README.md)**: Notifies all dependent objects when an object’s state changes, automatically updating them.
- **[State Pattern](./State/README.md)**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **[Strategy Pattern](./Strategy/README.md)**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **[Template Method Pattern](./TemplateMethod/README.md)**: Defines the steps of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for some steps.
- **[Visitor Pattern](./Visitor/README.md)**: Let you add further operations to objects without modifying them.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Consistency**: Ensures that your code follows best practices.
- **Reusability**: Patterns are designed to solve common problems, so you can reuse them in different parts of your application.
- **Scalability**: Helps your code adapt to changes and grow as your project evolves.
